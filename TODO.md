# Direction and Tasks

The IFC SDK repo is an experimental project.  We intend to continually evolve it to adapt it to new versions of ISO C++ and the IFC Specification.

## TODO
The SDK is currently a collection of header files.
  - Restructure it as C++ modules only.
  - Make it available through package managers
  - Add cross-platform testsuites
