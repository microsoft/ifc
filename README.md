# IFC SDK

The IFC SDK provides code to allow to read, write, and modify IFC files. It contains C++ 
structures that can be mapped directly onto the on-disk format.
See the IFC specification at [IFC Specification](https://github.com/microsoft/ifc-spec).

If you want to participate in the development of the IFC SDK, welcome! You can report issues, comment on pull requests, and learn about what we're working on. You can also submit pull requests to fix bugs or add features: see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

Finally, you can take our code and use it in other apps and libraries (according to the terms of our license, like everything else)

# Building and Running
This project uses CMake for defining projects, and the code has been tested to work on Windows and Linux. It can be built and run under WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) as well.

The JavaScript IFC viewer can be run by loading the [index.html](samples/sgraph-js/index.html) file in a browser.

IFC files to experiment with can be generated by using a current Microsoft C++ compiler. There are
a couple of IFC files checked into the repo for basic testing purposes. Longer term, we want to be
able to generate IFC files using the SDK itself. To generate an IFC file, you can use a current Visual C++ compiler. The following will generate an IFC containing almost everything in the test.cpp translation unit. Currently, non-inline functions or methods will not be generated into the IFC.

cl /std:c++20 /exportHeader test.cpp
