# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to grant us
the right to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

## Scope
The IFC SDK is an implementation of the [IFC Specification](https://github.com/microsoft/ifc-spec).  We are purposefully
limiting its scope to I/O operations for reading and writing IFC files, and to
simple utilities for formatting or viewing IFC files.  We welcome and we are looking
for contributions that fix gaps between the SDK and the Specification, or
for changes required to support C++ standards starting from C++20 and upwards.

We are not yet accepting contributions that expand the project scope beyond  adherence to the Specification, as explained above.  However, if you build cool apps or projects on top of the SDK, we would love to hear about them.

We are making the SDK available to the C++ community in the hope of helping to 
advance C++ Modules implementation across C++ compilers, and C++ Modules adoption in the C++ community at large.

## Formatting
There is a [.clang-format](.clang-format) file in the repo that should work with many editors automatically. Use the comment strings `// clang format off` and `// clang format on` to prevent automatic formatting when necessary to preserve specific formatting.

## Coding Conventions
Type names (e.g., classes, and enums) should use `PascalCase` naming convention.

Functions, methods, data members, parameters, and variables should use `snake_case` naming convention (e.g., `bit_length`).

Use the keywords `and`, `or`, and `not` rather than `&&`, `||`, and `!` for logical operators.

## Submitting a Pull Request

The SDK repo has open issues that track work which needs to be completed.
If you are unsure of where to start, you may want to:

* look for pinned issues, or
* check issues under the labels [`good first issue`][label:"good first issue"],
  [`high priority`][label:"high priority"], or [`help wanted`][label:"help wanted"].

## Reviewing a Pull Request

We love code reviews from contributors! Reviews from other contributors can often accelerate the reviewing process
by helping a PR reach a more finished state before maintainers review the changes. As a result, such a PR may require
fewer maintainer review iterations before reaching a "Ready to Merge" state.

To gain insight into our Code Review process, you can check out:

* pull requests which are [undergoing review][review:changes-requested]
* [Advice for Reviewing Pull Requests][wiki:advice-for-reviewing]

## PR Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure:

* Code has been formatted using the provided .clang-format file.
* Naming conventions are following the recommendations.
* Tests have been run locally (for at least one platform).
* Changes that will impact the binary format of an IFC will need to synchronize with the compiler(s) affected and will likely require a version change.

If your changes are derived from any other project, you _must_ mention it in the pull request description,
so we can determine whether the license is compatible and whether any other steps need to be taken.
